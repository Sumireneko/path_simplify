About Path Simplify plug-in
---------------------------
#### v0.4
Keep former selection if replace original

#### v0.2
This plug-in provide simplify for vector path.  
This plugin is used _simplify.py_ (by Omar Estrella) in internal,  
Thanks so much the author for create a usuful code.  

### About
This plugin is good to a shape that has many line segments and points  
for example United shape by Logical Operation(Boolean) or create from selection.  
If work success,it would be append new Vector Layer as contain simplified path data.

* Support Line segement(SVG <path>) shape only 
* For multiple shapes that selected
* For grouped shapes that selected (Simplify them keep groupe )
* Transformed shape
* Shapes that has hole pathes


#### Tolerance value  (**Default**:0.8)  
	Increase this value, effect strongly ,and more simple polygonal result.
 
* **Ineffective**: 0.0 - 0.4  
* **Good result**: 0.5 - 1.0  (Recommend)

A following Error dialog message If apply  this to the shape that contain Spline or Bezier curve.

=== ERROR : Line segment ONLY support ===  
The shape contain Spline or Bezier curvebr>  
(C,c,S,s,Q,q,T,t,H,h,V,v,A,a cmds in data)  
Please the segments change curve to line   

> 1.  Switch to "Edit Shapes Tool",  
> 2.  Select all segment(points) in the shape  
> 3.  Do "Segment to Line" command/button
