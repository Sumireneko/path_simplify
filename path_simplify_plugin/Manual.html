<h2>About Path Simplify plug-in</h2>
<h4>v0.8</h4>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
	This plug-in provide simplify for vector path.<br>
	It is good to a shape that has many line segments and points<br>
	for example United shape by Logical Operation(Boolean) or create from selection.<br>
	<br>
	If work success,it would be append new Vector Layer as contain simplified path data.<br>
	(Also,You can enable the option that "Remove original path",this mode does not create new layer)<br>

	In v0.6,it can be convert a vector brush path to simply line path (with outline)

	<ul>
	<li>Support Line segement(SVG &lt;path>) shape only 
	<li>For multiple shapes that selected
	<li>Transformed shape
	<li>Shapes that has hole pathes
	<li>For grouped shapes that selected (Simplify them keep groupe ) (v0.2)
	<li>The replace option that when finish simplified after, remove Original shape (v0.3)
	<li>Notice dialog (It appear when finish simplified ,and automatically close in 1500 msec after) (v0.3)
	<li>Keep former selection if replace original (v0.4)
	<li>Add integrate Boolean Operation buttons(Unite,Intersect,Subtract,Split) (v0.5)<br>
	<li>CurvePath,Open Path support. but total points are increase by convert the curve to line segments (v0.6)<br>
	<li>Make no process in the case that a short line path and the caes that zero array length.(v0.6)<br>
<br>
	 These are one-button shortcut for <em>Boolean operation → Simplify</em> workflow :-)<br>
</ul>
	
	<h4>Tolerance value</h4>
	<b>Default</b>:0.8<br>
	Increase this value, effect strongly ,and more simple polygonal result.
	<ul>
	<li style="color:red;"><b>Ineffective</b>: 0.0 - 0.4<br>
	<li style="color:green;"><b>Good result</b>: 0.5 - 1.0<br>
	<li><b>Polygonalize</b>: 1.5 - 2.5<br>
	<li style="color:orange;"><b>Simple N-gon</b>: 3.0 - 5.0<br>
	</ul>
	<h4>Quality option</h4>
	<b>Default</b>:Checked<br>
	If it checked,it try to make it as close to the original Shape as possible.
	
<br>
	 This plugin is used <em>simplify.py</em> (by Omar Estrella) in internal,<br>
	 Thanks so much the author for create a usuful code.<br>
</p>
<h3>About simplify.py</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li>The original code created by Omar Estrella 
	<li>It is a simple port of simplify.js by Vladimir Agafonkin (<a href="https://github.com/mourner/simplify-js">https://github.com/mourner/simplify-js</a>)
	<li><a href="https://github.com/omarestrella/simplify.py">https://github.com/omarestrella/simplify.py</a>
	<li>Lisense: Unlisense
	</ul>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
	Select a shape or multiple shapes in a VectorLayer,and use this.<br>
	This plugin good effect for the shape generated by Logical Operation(Boolean) or a shape converted from Selection.<br>
	(These has enoumous segments and points,so this plugin reduce them)
</p>

<h3>Boolean Shortcut</h3>
<p>
These buttons are shortcut for apply this simplify path plugin after Boolean operation.<br>
Because in Krita (currently 5.2.5 former),It create a lot of segments with boolean operation of vector pathes.<br>
The following buttons are available.
	<ul>
	<li>Unite(with Simplify):Create boolean union of mutiple shapes
	<li>Intersect(with Simplify):Create intersection of mutiple shapes
	<li>Subtract(with Simplify):Subtract multiple objects from the first selected one
	<li>Split(with Simplify):Split shapes with multiple subpaths into multiple shapes
	</ul>
	
</p>

<h3>A following limitation exist</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Line segement(&lt;path>) only 
	<li>Not support Rectangle,Ellipse Shape
	<li>Not support Spline or Bezier cuver (It can covert to line segments)
	</ul>
	
</p>
<h3>Error dialog</h3>
<p>A following Error dialog message If apply  this to the shape that contain Spline or Bezier curve.</p>
<p>
	=== ERROR : Line segment ONLY support ===<br>
The shape contain Spline or Bezier curvebr><br>
(C,c,S,s,Q,q,T,t,H,h,V,v,A,a cmds in data)<br>
<br>
Please the segments change curve to line <br>
<blockquote>
<ol>
 <li>Switch to "Edit Shapes Tool",<br>
 <li>Select all segment(points) in the shape<br>
 <li>Do "Segment to Line" command/button<br>
    (from RMB menu or Tool Options Docker)<br>
</ol>
</blockquote>
 So it will works.<br>
